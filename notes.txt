Scripts in pyp.json can start with [venv] to specify the default venv to execute the command in.
    Specifying the env or global before they run will overwrite it


I want the following commands

if no env (or global) is set, use default venv
default requirements are installed for all environments (including global, if used)

lock
    install locked version of requirements

setup
    setup initial project structure
    add .gitignore to it

install 
    install packages defined in pyp.json

install ...packages
    installs defined packages and updates the requirements for current env
    if global, installs packages but does not update requirements

remove
    removes all packages from pyp.json from current venv
    if global, only removes mentioned packages (not necessarily their requirements, for safety)

remove ...packages
    removes packages from current venv and updates pyp.json to remove them from venv or default requirements (where it occurs)

cleanse
    removes any installed packages that are not required by other packages and are not listed in pyp.json (default and current venv)
        pip list --not-required
        might want to list once, remove and the list again and remove (to remove base packages, and then their deps)
    if global, extra confirm step is used

purge
    removes all installed packages
    if global, extra confirm step is used

reinstall
    removes all installed packages from venv and reinstalls from pyp.json
    if global, extra confirm step is used

check-updates
    lists all installed packages with updates in current venv

update
    performs pip install -U for all packages from pyp.json
    updates requirements in pyp.json

update --purge/-p
    removes all packages from current venv
    installs latest version of all requirements from pyp.json
    updates requirements in pyp.json

<scripts from pyp.json>
run <scripts from pyp.json>
    execute with "pyp script-name"
    if script-name conflicts with already existing command, use "pyp run script-name"

venv name
    creates venv with name (ignores/errors if name is "default") 
    updates pyp.json to add an entry for the venv

venv --delete/-d name
    deletes venv with name (ignores/errors if name is "default")
    updates pyp.json to remove it

# Might not be able to make shell/unshell work, as we cannot modify PATH of the terminal properly
shell
    updates path to use the venv bin first, essentially like "activate" from venv but from pyp

unshell
    updates path to remove venv path it (effectively disable venv)
